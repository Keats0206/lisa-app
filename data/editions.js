    "Energy flows, synergy woes. To love one that is two, is a dangerous endeavor. When you look at yourself in the mirror is it you that you see or who you're pretending to be? Who is the one that you're showing to me? You cast a spell and I fly, then you drop me from the sky. Which side will I get from my Gemini?",

    "Sight unseen, the silence is deafening. Our connection has always been a paradox. You say like the ocean, you're deep but these are depths that no one can reach. I look into your eyes and see my world, you look into mine and see nothing. You say you speak but there is no sound in space. There is no sound in the void.",
